Owing to the pandemic scenario, various end-user industries such as crude steel production and aluminum production, chemical processing industry, metallurgy industry, ceramic industry, mining industry, and others were on a temporary halt during the government-imposed lockdown, such that to curb the new COVID-19 cases, thereby had decreased the demand for graphite felt used in various heat insulation applications of these end-user industries.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, graphite felts and components are also used in processes during the production of semiconductors. Considering the pandemic scenario, the demand for semiconductors has been increased, such that to fulfill the need for data centers, spiking telecommunications volume, increased computers sales, and more. For instance, according to the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA), the total production of semiconductors by the global electronics and IT industries was valued at USD 433.10 billion in 2020, registering a growth rate of 5% Y-o-Y compared to USD 412.30 billion in 2019, thereby had increased the demand for the market studied.\\\\n\\\\nOver the short term, increasing demand from industrial applications and energy efficiency and growing industrialization in the Asia-Pacific region are likely to drive the demand for the market studied. On the flipside, unfavorable conditions arising due to the impact of COVID-19, are going to somehow hinder the market growth. Increasing demand for renewable energy is likely to create opportunities for the market in the coming years.\\\\n\\\\nKey Market Trends\\\\n\\\\nIncreasing Applications from Heat Insulation Segment\\\\n\\\\nGraphite Felt has the properties of soft flexible high-temperature refractory insulation which makes it a good thermal insulator. It works in a vacuum and protected atmosphere environments up to ~3,000C.Graphite felt products are appreciated for their chemical and physical properties such as, chemically inert, thermal resistance, low thermal and electrical conductivity, low thermal expansion coefficient, low friction coefficient, and low coefficient of absorption of X-rays and electrons.Moreover, these products can be used in different fields, including, crude steel production and aluminum production, petrochemical industry, chemical processing industry, metallurgy industry, ceramic industry, mining industry, oil and gas industry, and other high technologies industries, catering to the needs of insulation. The continuous focus for high yield performance pushes these industries to operate their processes toward extreme temperatures and consequently creates a demand for high-temperature insulating products such as graphite felts, having improved performance.\\\\n\\\\nIn India, the production of crude steel and finished steel stood a 108.5 MT and 94.66 MT, respectively, in FY21. Moreover, crude steel production is expected to reach 112-114 MT (million ton), an increase of 8-9% YoY in FY22, thereby is expected to enhance the demand for the market studied from heat insulation application.In South Korea, with the increasing industrial demand for chemicals in the country, the petrochemical industry is also offering opportunities for investment, with a few companies taking the initiative. For instance, in July 2019, GS Energy and Lotte Chemical planned to build a petrochemical plant as a joint venture. The companies invested USD 677 million for the construction of the plant by 2023, which will further enhance the demand for the market studied.Graphite felt is specifically designed to perform as a thermal insulator for high-temperature vacuum and inert gas furnaces, among other applications. Furnaces are mostly used as a major component of a central heating system. These are permanently installed to provide heat to an interior space through intermediary fluid movement, which may be air, steam, or hot water.Graphite Felts also find applications as heat shields and sinks.\\\\n\\\\nHeat shields are blankets manufactured from graphite felts and suspended along the side of the facility or blanketed over equipment for protection. Graphite felts provide an excellent protective barrier between fragile insulation materials and the furnace hot zone.Heat sinks are a type of heat exchanger that transfers heat generated by an electronic or mechanical device into a moving coolant fluid. The fluid transfers the heat away from the device, allowing it to cool to the desired temperature.Therefore, all the aforementioned factors are expected to show significant impact on the demand for the market studied.\\\\n\\\\nChina to Dominate the Market in Asia-Pacific Region\\\\n\\\\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, China is the largest economy in terms of GDP. The country witnessed about 6% growth in its GDP during 2019, even after the trade disturbance caused due to its trade war with the United States. The economic growth rate of China in 2020 was initially expected to be moderate as compared to the previous year. However, due to the onset of COVID-19 in 2020, the economic growth of China witnessed a contraction to 2.3% and is expected to witness recovery at a rate of 8.10% in 2021.In the year 2020, the value-added industrial output of the country was 31.3 trillion Yuan, which accounted for ~30% of the world\\'s manufacturing output.In 2020, China\\'s steel producers produced 1,324.8 million metric tons of steel which was an increase of 7.7% compared to 2019. In 2020, 7 of the top 10 steel producers by volume of production were from China. The leading steel companies of the country are China Baowu Group, HBIS Group, Shagang Group, Ansteel Group, Jianlong Group, Shougang Group, Shandong Steel Group.The government of China has decided to cut down the energy consumption per GDP by 3% in 2021 in order to reduce emissions. Since the iron and steel industry is a major polluter, the China\\'s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has planned to cut steel output as the most effective way to cut emissions. This is likely to have a negative impact on the market studied.According to China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC), the gas consumption in China was expected to rise to 320 billion cubic meters (BCM) in 2020; however, COVID-19 has disrupted the economic activities, thereby affecting the gas demand in the domestic market. But considering the scope of market demand, gas consumption is expected to surge to around 600 BCM by 2040. In order to meet the growing gas demand, the country is planning to double its gas production to 325 BCM till 2040. With such plans, the country is likely to witness numerous refining and gas processing-related construction projects over the long run, which is further expected to create a market for graphite felt for assisting in corrosive and high temperature processing operations.China, under its 14th Five Year Plan (2021-2025), set the capacity for coal-power capacity to about 1,100 GW. The network operator, State Grid, and China Electricity Council are aiming to develop hundreds of new coal-fired power stations in the country. The country is looking forward to developing power plants, despite the overcapacity in the sector, where more than half of the coal-power plants are witnessing losses and a few plants are running at less than 50% of their capacities.\\\\n\\\\nCompetitive Landscape\\\\n\\\\nThe global graphite felt market is a partially consolidated market with intense competition among the top players to capture the major share in the market.

The HOPE-2 clinical trial met its primary efficacy endpoint of mid-PUL v1.2 as well as various skeletal and cardiac endpoints suggesting clinically relevant slowing of disease progression. CAP-1002 is Capricor\\\\u2019s cell-based therapeutic candidate whose mechanism of action is immunomodulatory, anti-fibrotic and has been shown to regenerate skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. This final data will be presented today at this year\\\\u2019s World Muscle Society Virtual Congress (WMS).\\\\n\\\\nDr. Craig McDonald, the national principal investigator for the HOPE-2 clinical trial and UC Davis professor and chair of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation commented,\\\\u00a0\\\\u201cThis groundbreaking study is extremely exciting as we saw statistically significant changes of CAP-1002 in both skeletal and cardiac function. For these older boys who have limited therapeutic options, these data support the belief that CAP-1002 may become an important therapeutic option and possibly slow the progression of DMD.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nHOPE-2 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 clinical trial of the Company\\\\u2019s lead investigational therapy, CAP-1002, in boys and young men who have DMD and are non-ambulant, the later stage of the disease process. The trial was conducted at nine sites across the United States. Study patients were treated via intravenous delivery with either CAP-1002 (150 million cells per infusion) or placebo every 3 months. Data from a total of 20 patients was analyzed (12 placebo and 8 treated) at the 12-month time-point in the intent to treat (ITT) population. Approximately 80% of the patients were non-ambulant and all patients were on a stable regimen of steroids. Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups. Final data analysis demonstrated that young men in the advanced stages of DMD experienced improvements in skeletal and cardiac measurements after receiving four doses of CAP-1002 over the course of 1 year.\\\\n\\\\nSubjects in the trial were evaluated using the Performance of the Upper Limb (PUL), a validated tool specifically designed for assessing high (shoulder), mid (elbow) and distal (wrist & hand) function, with a conceptual framework reflecting the progression of weakness in upper limb function.\\\\n\\\\nFinal Efficacy Results\\\\n\\\\n12-month Difference in Change from Baseline\\\\u2020 \\\\u0394, CAP-1002 vs. Placebo (n=8, n=12)p-valueSkeletal Muscle (Upper Limb Function)Mid-level PUL (version 1.2)2.60.01Shoulder + Mid + Distal PUL (version 1.2)3.20.02Shoulder + Mid + Distal PUL (version 2.0)1.80.04Cardiac Function LV Ejection Fraction %4.00.002LV End Diastolic Volume, Indexed mL\\\\/m2-12.4\\\\u20210.03LV End Systolic Volume, Indexed mL\\\\/m2-4.2\\\\u20210.01Creatine Kinase-MB (% of total CK)-2.2\\\\u20210.02\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2020Non-parametric mixed model repeated measures analysis with percentile ranked baseline, treatment, visit, visit-by-treatment interaction, PUL entry-item score at stratification, and site as model effects.

With the exception of two hypersensitivity reactions early in the clinical trial, which were mitigated with a common pre-medication regimen, there were no serious safety signals identified by the HOPE-2 Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cThe significance of this data is vitally important to patients and the DMD community. The data suggests that CAP-1002 slowed the decline of DMD in patients for whom few options currently exist,\\\\u201d said Dr. Linda Marb\\\\u00e1n, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Capricor. \\\\u201cNow that we have clarity from the FDA and based on the strength of this data set, we are poised to embark on the HOPE-3 pivotal trial once we have secured an appropriate partner that can help drive CAP-1002 forward towards commercialization. Most importantly, we are thankful to the patients and families who participated in this study so that we can demonstrate the impact of CAP-1002 in treating DMD.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nThese data were recently accepted at this year\\\\u2019s World Muscle Society Virtual Congress as a late-breaking oral presentation, due to its high-impact research findings that are of great interest to congress participants. The late-breaking results will be presented today, September 24, 2021.\\\\n\\\\nThis is the second clinical trial investigating CAP-1002 showing similar results in the treatment of DMD patients. Capricor completed the HOPE-Duchenne (Phase 1\\\\/2) trial in 2019, the results of which were published in\\\\u00a0Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. The Company has initiated a technology transfer with Lonza, a leading global CMO to prepare for commercial manufacturing of CAP-1002.\\\\n\\\\nDr. McDonald is a professor of pediatrics, professor and chair of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, director of Rehabilitation Services and director of the Neuromuscular Disease Clinics at UC Davis Health.

Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a CAGR of around 4% during 2021-2026. Keeping in mind the uncertainties of COVID-19, the analyst is continuously tracking and evaluating the direct as well as the indirect influence of the pandemic. These insights are included in the report as a major market contributor.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAutomotive refinish coatings refer to polyurethane, acrylics or alkyd-based coatings used by vehicle body shops and repair centers. These coatings are applied to new\\\\/old passenger and commercial vehicles to cover up the damages on the body caused by extreme temperatures, accidents and impact from stones. Some of the commonly used refinish coatings include primer, filler, topcoat, basecoat and activator or hardener coatings. They are either solvent-borne, water-borne or ultraviolet (UV) cured. Among these, water-borne coatings have lower levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) than solvent-borne variants, thereby making them highly effective for all automobiles.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe growing automotive industry across the globe represents one of the key factors creating a positive outlook for the market. Furthermore, the increasing number of road accidents and collisions has resulted in the rising requirement for repair and maintenance activities, thereby stimulating the market growth. In line with this, there is a shift in consumer preference toward customized aftermarket modifications of the vehicles. Automotive refining coatings offer improved aesthetic appeal, surface protection and resistance to heat, temperature and corrosion. Additionally, various product innovations, such as the development of environment-friendly refinish coatings, are acting as other growth-inducing factors. These coatings are manufactured using organic chemicals and have a custom color, faster cure time and minimal VOC emissions. Other factors, including the rising expenditure capacities of consumers, along with the growing demand for recreational vehicles, are anticipated to drive the market further.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nKey Market Segmentation\\\\n\\\\nThe analyst provides an analysis of the key trends in each sub-segment of the global automotive refinish coatings market, along with forecasts at the global, regional and country level from 2021-2026.

However, COVID-19 is having a slightly negative impact on the pet insurance market as the diagnosis and treatment procedures are witnessing decreasing rates.\\\\n\\\\nThe factors that are driving the market growth include an increasing number of pet adoption and rising awareness regarding pet insurance. According to the People\\'s Dispensary for Sick Animals, in the United Kingdom (UK), the pet dog and cat population in 2013 was found to be 7.8 million and 9.5 million, respectively, which increased to 9.9 million and 10.9 million, respectively, in 2019.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, as per the report \\'\\'Pets in Australia: A national survey of pets and people\\'\\' in 2019, the expenditure on pets has increased tremendously owing to the increasing pet adoption. The report estimated that people spend over AUD 13 billion per year to keep the pets fed, healthy, and well-accessorized, with food and veterinary services continuing to account for half of all ongoing expenditure. Out of this, nearly 2.6 billion were spent on veterinary services in the country. Therefore, the rise in disposable income is another major factor influencing animal health expenditure. Apart from the per capita animal health expenditure, industries across the world are also spending more in the field of veterinary disease diagnosis and treatment.\\\\n\\\\nMoreover, the adoption of pet health insurance is exploding in popularity because of a strong economy, improved consumer awareness, high disposable income, and easier claims processing across the world. The pet health insurance coverage is expected to reimburse the diagnostic testing and imaging (e.g. X-rays, ultrasound, and MRI), and it covers every accident and illness under one policy. Some of the most common diagnostic tests covered by pet insurance are radiographs, ultrasounds, CT scans, and MRIs.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to the North American Pet Health Insurance Association (NAPHIA), in 2019, the adoption rates of pet health insurance in the United States was observed to be about 2.3% among dogs compared to 1.7% in 2017 and 0.4% in cats compared to 0.3% in the year 2017. This indicates the rising adoption of pet health insurance among pet owners, which is expected to positively impact the market. There are also many players operating worldwide, and many of these players market multiple white label or co-branded products with the help of pet insurance. Furthermore, there is also an increase in the entry of new players, including Figo Pet Insurance, 4Paws Insurance, and Toto Pet Insurance. Thus, the rise in adoption of pet animals and increasing awareness for pet insurance is expected boost the growth of the Pet Insurance market over the forecast period.\\\\n\\\\nKey Market Trends\\\\n\\\\nDogs Segment is Expected to Show Lucrative Growth Opportunity in the Global Pet Insurance Market\\\\n\\\\nThe past few years have observed a significant rise in the adoption of animals, especially dogs, as they are among the favorite companions of human beings. According to \\\\\"The Federation Cynologique Internationale\\\\\", the approximate total number of dogs (PURE-BRED OR NOT) registered in 2019 is found to be 9,950,000 as compared to 9,000,000 in 2017.?Therefore, with the high number and demand for dogs, there is a corresponding increase in the number of insurances for dogs.\\\\n\\\\nMoreover, the prevalence of several diseases among dogs coupled with high prices of treatments are the major contributor to the adoption of pet insurance among dogs. Dogs get cancer almost at the same rate at which humans get, while cats get affected by cancer in fewer numbers. According to the Veterinary Cancer Society, cancer is the leading cause of death in 47% of dogs, especially those that are over the age of 10, globally. Even though in most cases, cancer is a disease found in aging animals, however, some families or breeds of dogs, such as Rottweiler, Bernese Mountain Dog, and Bouvier des Flandres, German Shepherd, Great Dane, Labrador Retriever, Bichon Frise, Boxer, and Golden Retriever have a higher incidence or tendency for developing cancer at a young age.\\\\n\\\\nAs per a report published by Association of British Insurers in 2019, reported that 4.8 million pets in the United Kingdom are insured, of which 2.8 million are dogs. This data indicates that there is a huge adoption of pet insurance among dogs due to huge burden of diseases among dogs. All these afore mentioned factors are expected to propel market growth.\\\\n\\\\nNorth America Dominates the Global Pet Insurance Market\\\\n\\\\nIn the North American region, the United States accounted for the largest market share. High pet ownership, awareness, increasing pet insurance, and technological advancements in the diagnostics field are the major driving factors in the US region. The country\\'s socio-economic conditions are good enough to give economic support to the market on the production and at the end-user level. In the United States, 67% of US households, or about 85 million families, own a pet, according to the 2019-2020 National Pet Owners Survey conducted by the American Pet Products Association (APPA). According to the American Pet Products Association\\'s 2017-2018 National Pet Owners Survey, the total number of dogs owned was 89.7 million and cats were 94.2 million in the United States. In 2018, the data published by APPA stated that the total pet healthcare expenditure was USD 75.38 billion by 2019, while the expenditure in 2017 was USD 69.51 billion.\\\\n\\\\nMoreover, in October 2019, Embrace entered into a partnership with PawSupport for a 24\\\\/7 Pet Help Line for assistance through online chat, email, and video chat. This strategy is expected to rovide new services to policyholders. This strategy enabled company to expand their operations, thereby strengthening their market presence. Hence, owing to all these market development strategies currently happening in this region is expected to propel market growth.\\\\n\\\\nKey Topics Covered:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n1 INTRODUCTION\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n4 MARKET DYNAMICS\\\\r\\\\n4.1 Market Overview\\\\r\\\\n4.2 Market Drivers\\\\r\\\\n4.2.1 Increasing Number of Pet Adoption\\\\r\\\\n4.2.2 Rising Awareness Regarding Pet Insurance\\\\r\\\\n4.3 Market Restraints\\\\r\\\\n4.3.1 Lack of Standardized Pet Health Codes for Reimbursement\\\\r\\\\n4.3.2 Low Adoption in Emerging Countries\\\\r\\\\n4.4 Porter\\'s Five Force Analysis\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n5 MARKET SEGMENTATION\\\\r\\\\n5.1 By Policy\\\\r\\\\n5.2 By Animal\\\\r\\\\n5.3 By Provider\\\\r\\\\n5.4 Geography\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE\\\\r\\\\n6.1 Company Profiles\\\\r\\\\n6.1.1 Anicom Holdings Inc\\\\r\\\\n6.1.2 Embrace Pet Insurance Agency, LLC\\\\r\\\\n6.1.3 Figo Pet Insurance LLC.\\\\r\\\\n6.1.4 Hartville Group\\\\r\\\\n6.1.5 Healthy Paws Pet Insurance, LLC\\\\r\\\\n6.1.6 Hollard\\\\r\\\\n6.1.7 Oneplan\\\\r\\\\n6.1.8 Petfirst Healthcare LLC\\\\r\\\\n6.1.9 Petplan\\\\r\\\\n6.1.10 The Oriental Insurance Company Ltd.\\\\r\\\\n6.1.11 Medibank Private Limited\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n7 MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND FUTURE TRENDS\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFor more information about this report visit https:\\\\/\\\\/www.researchandmarkets.com\\\\/r\\\\/qt8i6w\",\"link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.globenewswire.com\\\\/news-release\\\\/2021\\\\/09\\\\/24\\\\/2302850\\\\/28124\\\\/en\\\\/Global-Pet-Insurance-Market-2021-to-2026-Growth-Trends-COVID-19-Impact-and-Forecasts.html\",\"symbols\":[],\"tags\":[\"RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND REPORTS\",\"PET CARE AND SERVICES\",\"PET OWNER\",\"PET PRODUCT\",\"PET INSURANCE\",\"PETS INSURANCE\",\"PET HEALTHCARE\"]},{\"date\":\"2021-09-24T10:38:00+00:00\",\"title\":\"Worldwide Polystyrene Industry to 2026 - China to Dominate the Asia-Pacific Region\",\"content\":\"Dublin, Sept.  24, 2021  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \\\\\"Polystyrene Market - Growth, Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts (2021 - 2026)\\\\\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com\\'s offering.\\\\n\\\\nThe polystyrene market size was estimated at over USD 30 billion in 2020, and the market is projected to register a CAGR of over 4% during the forecast period (2021-2026).\\\\n\\\\nThe market was negatively impacted by COVID-19 in 2020. The global residential home construction revenue has witnessed a decline of 7% in 2020, compared to 2019, owing to lockdowns, unavailability of raw materials, and shortage of laborers. At the same time, demand for packaging products, including food packaging and non-food packaging, has increased owing to the rising trend of consumer spending on e-commerce and food delivery applications, thereby positively impacting the demand for polystyrene.\\\\n\\\\nOver the short term, major factors driving the market studied are recycling in the polystyrene industry and the growing consumer electronics market. The global consumer electronics industry has been growing rapidly across the world over the years, owing to the consistently increasing demand for cellular phones, portable computing devices, gaming systems, and other personal electronic devices. For instance, the Indian electronics market is expected to reach USD 400 billion by 2025. Additionally, India is expected to become the fifth-largest consumer electronics and appliances industry in the world by 2025.\\\\n\\\\nOn the flip side, increasing the ban on polystyrene across North America and Europe and the availability of high-performance substitutes are likely to hinder the market. Asia-Pacific dominated the market across the world, with the largest consumption in countries such as India and China.\\\\n\\\\nKey Market Trends\\\\n\\\\nHigh Impact Polystyrene (HIPS) Type to Dominate the Market\\\\n\\\\nHigh impact polystyrene contains rubber. It is less transparent than GPPS. It is mainly used for products that require high-impact resistance.HIPS has a standard flow but is less glossy than GPPS. It is crack-resistant and is used in injection molding. HIPS also has good dimensional stability. It is easy to paint and glue and has a low cost. It is used for housing and covers, low-strength structural components, printed graphics, models and prototypes, fixtures, etc. Majorly, HIPS are sold in high and medium grades. Other grades include ignition resistance, high-gloss grades, and environment stress crack-resistant grade.Packaging is the largest segment for HIPS. It is used for food packaging (of meat trays, egg cartons, fruit trays, dairy packaging, etc.), industrial packaging, and consumer packaging ( of cassettes, CD covers, etc.).Driven by the rise in population, demand for packaged food and beverage is set to witness further growth during the forecast period. The unprecedented shift from rural to urban living is a major demographic that is impacting the global consumption of packaged food.China stands to be the world\\'s largest manufacturing economy and exporter, due to which the country\\'s packaging requirement is huge. The packaging industry in China is expected to register tremendous growth, with a CAGR of nearly 6.8%, to reach CNY 2 trillion during the forecast period.However, the United States has banned the use of polystyrene in food packaging products such as boxes, containers, and carry bags, which is likely to impact the market growth negatively.HIPS are also used majorly in electronic and appliances applications, such as in computer housings, TV housings, and freezer and refrigerator liners appliances housings.Asia-Pacific is the largest consumer of high-impact polystyrene. It also produces about half of the world\\'s HIPS. Europe and North America follow Asia-Pacific in consumption. Asia-Pacific is forecasted to be the fastest-growing region during the forecast period.\\\\n\\\\nChina to Dominate the Asia-Pacific Region\\\\n\\\\nChina\\'s construction industry developed rapidly due to the central government\\'s push for infrastructure investment as a means to sustain economic growth.However, due to the onset of COVID-19 in 2020, the economic growth of China is now expected to contract to a considerable extent. According to International Monetary Fund, the country\\'s GDP is estimated to have grown by 1.9% in 2020 while recovering to 8.2% growth in 2021, subject to post-pandemic recovery.China\\'s 13th Five Year Plan started in 2016, and it was an important year for the country\\'s engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) industry. In addition, the country ventured into new business models domestically and internationally during the year. Although the construction sector slowed down after 2013, it is still a major contributor to the GDP of the country.The country announced 300 major construction projects in Beijing in 2019. These 300 projects included 100 infrastructure projects, 100 projects focusing on the improvement of people\\'s livelihoods, and 100 projects for high-end technological industries. The investment of the projects is expected to reach USD 35 billion.Moreover, the country witnessed rapid growth in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) market. The growth of the FMCG market was majorly driven by the increased spending on premium and healthier products by the middle-class consumers in the country.China is the world\\'s largest electronics production base and offers tough competition to the existing upstream producers, like South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. Electronic products, such as smartphones, OLED TVs, tablets, and so on, have the highest growth in the market in the consumer electronics segment. With the increase in the disposable income of the middle-class population, the demand for electronic products is projected to grow in the near future.Furthermore, the Chinese government has started implementing policies to support and encourage innovations in medical devices. The \\\\\"Made in China 2025\\\\\" initiative aims to improve industry efficiency, product quality, and brand reputation. This is expected to increase the number of domestic medical device manufacturers, thus, increasing the competitiveness in the market. Demand for polystyrene exists in the medical device sector, in disposable items, such as tissue culture trays, test tubes, Petri dishes, diagnostic components, and housing for test kits, among many others.The medical device market in China is considered to be one of the fastest-growing market sectors and was estimated to cross over USD 95 billion by the end of 2020. The number of private hospitals in the country is relatively small, and the healthcare product procurement is majorly driven by large public hospitals, which has led to the increasing usage of medical devices in public hospitals and thus has stimulated the demand for optical coatings from the sector.In 2019, Chinese health expenditure was recorded to be ~USD 750 billion, which accounted for ~5.3% of the country\\'s GDP.

       "  'title': 'Global Pharmaceutical Glass Packaging Market Report 2021 with COVID-19 Impact Analysis - Forecast to 2028',\n",
       "  'content': 'Dublin, Sept.  24, 2021  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Global Pharmaceutical Glass Packaging Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report by Product (Vials, Bottles, Cartridges & Syringes, Ampoules), by Drug Type (Generic, Branded, Biologic), by Region, and Segment Forecasts, 2021-2028\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com\\'s offering. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe global pharmaceutical glass packaging market size is expected to reach USD 7.46 billion by 2028. It is expected to expand at a CAGR of 8.8% from 2021 to 2028.\\n\\nThe demand for pharmaceutical glass packaging is projected to be driven by the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in emerging economies, especially in the Asia Pacific region.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cost sensitivity in the healthcare sector and the growing significance of biotech drugs have resulted in the establishment of stringent regulations related to drug delivery products. Many pharmaceutical drugs manufacturing companies are focused on increasing the shelf life of a drug and are therefore making investments in the research and development of glass vials. The newly developed products are expected to aid the growth of glass vials due to the expansive number of applications.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe generic drug type segment is expected to witness the fastest growth in terms of revenue as well as volume over the forecast period. This is due to the significant increase in the volume of generics in the country, which is estimated to face a rapid change in the market dynamics primarily due to the increased competitive intensity and customer consolidation.\\r\\n\\r\\nGlass packaging is highly preferred in the pharmaceutical industry as it is easy to sterilize with heat and does not react with most of the drugs and medicines being chemically inert. The colored glass packaging can protect the medicines from different wavelengths, including UV rays of the sun. Additionally, glass is easily available all over the world and can be recycled, which has made it an ideal material for the packaging of pharmaceutical products.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe market in North America is expected to witness steady growth in the years to come on account of global key players present in the region. With the rising volume of generic drugs, glass packaging has been increasingly adopted owing to the preexisting established supply chain. The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has positively impacted the market growth due to the growing use of pharmaceutical glass packaging in the packaging of immunity-boosting drugs.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompanies in the pharmaceutical glass packaging industry have been trying to improve product strength to reduce breakage during the filling of vials. In September 2019, Corning Inc. got approval from the FDA to market its Corning Valor Glass, which enables superior chemical durability and improves resistance to breakage, damage, and particulate contamination.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor instance, Gerresheimer AG, a key German-based pharma glass packaging manufacturer, has developed a metal-free 1 ml Gx RTF long Luer Lock syringe. This particular syringe uses a new technology in which the pin used to shape the cone is made of a special ceramic material instead of the conventional tungsten or alternative metal.\\r\\n\\r\\nPharmaceutical Glass Packaging Market Report Highlights\\n\\nIn terms of revenue, the generic drug type segment led the market and accounted for a 71.2% share in 2020. Distrust in the quality of unbranded generic medicines by physicians/patients, high out-of-pocket patient spending for drug purchases, and insufficient government promotion of unbranded generics are likely to promote the use of branded generic drugs over the coming yearsThe ampoules product segment accounted for the largest volume share of 74.7% in 2020. Glass ampoules have been widely used in packaging injection drugs. Ampoules are one of the most used glass-based primary packaging for injectables, and their growth is clearly being seen in the cost-sensitive markets of emerging nationsGlass delamination has been a growing concern and has been emphasized by the FDA for better compatibility testing of containers and drugs. The development of glass vials by pharma packaging manufacturers that reduce the chances of delamination and breakage is estimated to result in the continuation of the trend of glass vials occupying a major market share over the coming years\\n\\nPharmaceutical Glass Packaging Market Variables, Trends & Scope\\n\\nMarket Lineage Outlook\\n\\nParent Market Outlook: Glass Packaging MarketRelated Market Outlook: Pharmaceutical Packaging Market\\n\\nPenetration & Growth Prospect Mapping\\n\\nValue Chain Analysis\\n\\nRaw Material TrendsMajor Raw Materials AnalysisType 1 - Borosilicate GlassBoric OxideType II Treated Soda LimeType III Regular Soda LimeProcurement Best PracticesManufacturing TrendsTechnology TrendsSales Channel Analysis\\n\\nRegulatory Framework\\n\\nInternational Organization for StandardizationOccupational Hazard and Safety Management CertificationU.S. Food and Drug Administration\\n\\nMarket Driver Analysis\\n\\nGrowth of Pharmaceutical Industry in Emerging EconomiesCommodity Value of Glass Increased with Recyclability\\n\\nMarket Restraints Analysis\\n\\nIncreased Relevance of Alternate SourceChallenges Associated with Glass Surface\\n\\nMajor Deals & Strategic Alliances Analysis\\n\\nJoint VenturesMergers & AcquisitionNew Product Launches & Capacity Expansion\\n\\nCompanies Mentioned\\n\\nCorning IncorporatedNipro CorporationSGD S.A.Stolzle-Oberglas GmbHWest Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.Schott AGGerresheimer AGBormioli Pharma S.r.lShandong Medicinal Glass Co., Ltd.Beatson ClarkArdagh Group S.A.Arab Pharmaceutical Glass Co.Piramal Enterprises Ltd.Sisecam GroupOwens-Illinois, Inc.\\n\\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/aet3xp',\n",

Considering the pandemic scenario, the demand for semiconductors has been increased, such that to fulfill the need for data centers, spiking telecommunications volume, increased computers sales, and more. For instance, according to the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA), the total production of semiconductors by the global electronics and IT industries was valued at USD 433.10 billion in 2020, registering a growth rate of 5% Y-o-Y compared to USD 412.30 billion in 2019, thereby had increased the demand for the market studied.\\n\\nOver the short term, increasing demand from industrial applications and energy efficiency and growing industrialization in the Asia-Pacific region are likely to drive the demand for the market studied. On the flipside, unfavorable conditions arising due to the impact of COVID-19, are going to somehow hinder the market growth. Increasing demand for renewable energy is likely to create opportunities for the market in the coming years.\\n\\nKey Market Trends\\n\\nIncreasing Applications from Heat Insulation Segment\\n\\nGraphite Felt has the properties of soft flexible high-temperature refractory insulation which makes it a good thermal insulator. It works in a vacuum and protected atmosphere environments up to ~3,000C.Graphite felt products are appreciated for their chemical and physical properties such as, chemically inert, thermal resistance, low thermal and electrical conductivity, low thermal expansion coefficient, low friction coefficient, and low coefficient of absorption of X-rays and electrons.Moreover, these products can be used in different fields, including, crude steel production and aluminum production, petrochemical industry, chemical processing industry, metallurgy industry, ceramic industry, mining industry, oil and gas industry, and other high technologies industries, catering to the needs of insulation. The continuous focus for high yield performance pushes these industries to operate their processes toward extreme temperatures and consequently creates a demand for high-temperature insulating products such as graphite felts, having improved performance.\\n\\nIn India, the production of crude steel and finished steel stood a 108.5 MT and 94.66 MT, respectively, in FY21. Moreover, crude steel production is expected to reach 112-114 MT (million ton), an increase of 8-9% YoY in FY22, thereby is expected to enhance the demand for the market studied from heat insulation application.In South Korea, with the increasing industrial demand for chemicals in the country, the petrochemical industry is also offering opportunities for investment, with a few companies taking the initiative. For instance, in July 2019, GS Energy and Lotte Chemical planned to build a petrochemical plant as a joint venture. The companies invested USD 677 million for the construction of the plant by 2023, which will further enhance the demand for the market studied.Graphite felt is specifically designed to perform as a thermal insulator for high-temperature vacuum and inert gas furnaces, among other applications. Furnaces are mostly used as a major component of a central heating system. These are permanently installed to provide heat to an interior space through intermediary fluid movement, which may be air, steam, or hot water.Graphite Felts also find applications as heat shields and sinks.\\n\\nHeat shields are blankets manufactured from graphite felts and suspended along the side of the facility or blanketed over equipment for protection. Graphite felts provide an excellent protective barrier between fragile insulation materials and the furnace hot zone.Heat sinks are a type of heat exchanger that transfers heat generated by an electronic or mechanical device into a moving coolant fluid. The fluid transfers the heat away from the device, allowing it to cool to the desired temperature.Therefore, all the aforementioned factors are expected to show significant impact on the demand for the market studied.\\n\\nChina to Dominate the Market in Asia-Pacific Region\\n\\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, China is the largest economy in terms of GDP. The country witnessed about 6% growth in its GDP during 2019, even after the trade disturbance caused due to its trade war with the United States. The economic growth rate of China in 2020 was initially expected to be moderate as compared to the previous year. However, due to the onset of COVID-19 in 2020, the economic growth of China witnessed a contraction to 2.3% and is expected to witness recovery at a rate of 8.10% in 2021.In the year 2020, the value-added industrial output of the country was 31.3 trillion Yuan, which accounted for ~30% of the world\\'s manufacturing output.In 2020, China\\'s steel producers produced 1,324.8 million metric tons of steel which was an increase of 7.7% compared to 2019. In 2020, 7 of the top 10 steel producers by volume of production were from China. The leading steel companies of the country are China Baowu Group, HBIS Group, Shagang Group, Ansteel Group, Jianlong Group, Shougang Group, Shandong Steel Group.The government of China has decided to cut down the energy consumption per GDP by 3% in 2021 in order to reduce emissions. Since the iron and steel industry is a major polluter, the China\\'s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has planned to cut steel output as the most effective way to cut emissions. This is likely to have a negative impact on the market studied.According to China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC), the gas consumption in China was expected to rise to 320 billion cubic meters (BCM) in 2020; however, COVID-19 has disrupted the economic activities, thereby affecting the gas demand in the domestic market. But considering the scope of market demand, gas consumption is expected to surge to around 600 BCM by 2040. In order to meet the growing gas demand, the country is planning to double its gas production to 325 BCM till 2040. With such plans, the country is likely to witness numerous refining and gas processing-related construction projects over the long run, which is further expected to create a market for graphite felt for assisting in corrosive and high temperature processing operations.China, under its 14th Five Year Plan (2021-2025), set the capacity for coal-power capacity to about 1,100 GW. The network operator, State Grid, and China Electricity Council are aiming to develop hundreds of new coal-fired power stations in the country. The country is looking forward to developing power plants, despite the overcapacity in the sector, where more than half of the coal-power plants are witnessing losses and a few plants are running at less than 50% of their capacities.\\n\\nCompetitive Landscape\\n\\nThe global graphite felt market is a partially consolidated market with intense competition among the top players to capture the major share in the market. Some of the major key players in the market include SGL Carbon, Morgan Advanced Materials, Nippon Carbon Co. Ltd, MERSEN GRAPHITE, and Schunk Carbon Technology, among others.\\n\\nReasons to Purchase this report:\\n\\nThe market estimate (ME) sheet in Excel format3 months of analyst support\\n\\nKey Topics Covered:\\r\\n\\r\\n1 INTRODUCTION\\n\\n2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\\r\\n\\r\\n3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\r\\n\\r\\n4 MARKET DYNAMICS\\r\\n4.1 Drivers\\r\\n4.1.1 Increasing Demand from Industrial Applications and Energy Efficiency\\r\\n4.1.2 Growing Industrialization in the Asia-Pacific Region\\r\\n4.2 Restraints\\r\\n4.2.1 Unfavorable Conditions Arising Due to the Impact of COVID-19\\r\\n4.3 Industry Value-Chain Analysis\\r\\n4.4 Porters Five Forces Analysis\\r\\n4.4.1 Bargaining Power of Suppliers\\r\\n4.4.2 Bargaining Power of Consumers\\r\\n4.4.3 Threat of New Entrants\\r\\n4.4.4 Threat of Substitute Products\\r\\n4.4.5 Degree of Competition\\r\\n\\r\\n5 MARKET SEGMENTATION\\r\\n5.1 Raw Material Type\\r\\n5.1.1 Polyacrylonitrile (PAN)\\r\\n5.1.2 Rayon\\r\\n5.1.3 Petroleum Pitch\\r\\n5.2 Application\\r\\n5.2.1 Heat Insulation\\r\\n5.2.2 Batteries\\r\\n5.2.3 Semiconductors\\r\\n5.2.4 Other Applications\\r\\n5.3 Geography\\r\\n5.3.1 Asia-Pacific\\r\\n5.3.1.1 China\\r\\n5.3.1.2 India\\r\\n5.3.1.3 Japan\\r\\n5.3.1.4 South Korea\\r\\n5.3.1.5 Rest of Asia-Pacific\\r\\n5.3.2 North America\\r\\n5.3.2.1 United States\\r\\n5.3.2.2 Canada\\r\\n5.3.2.3 Mexico\\r\\n5.3.3 Europe\\r\\n5.3.3.1 Germany\\r\\n5.3.3.2 United Kingdom\\r\\n5.3.3.3 France\\r\\n5.3.3.4 Italy\\r\\n5.3.3.5 Rest of Europe\\r\\n5.3.4 South America\\r\\n5.3.4.1 Brazil\\r\\n5.3.4.2 Argentina\\r\\n5.3.4.3 Rest of South America\\r\\n5.3.5 Middle-East and Africa\\r\\n5.3.5.1 Saudi Arabia\\r\\n5.3.5.2 South Africa\\r\\n5.3.5.3 Rest of Middle-East and Africa\\r\\n\\r\\n6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE\\r\\n6.1 Mergers and Acquisitions, Joint Ventures, Collaborations, and Agreements\\r\\n6.2 Market Share Analysis/Ranking Analysis\\r\\n6.3 Strategies Adopted by Leading Players\\r\\n6.4 Company Profiles\\r\\n6.4.1 Anssen Metallurgy Group Co.

The HOPE-2 clinical trial met its primary efficacy endpoint of mid-PUL v1.2 as well as various skeletal and cardiac endpoints suggesting clinically relevant slowing of disease progression. CAP-1002 is Capricor’s cell-based therapeutic candidate whose mechanism of action is immunomodulatory, anti-fibrotic and has been shown to regenerate skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. This final data will be presented today at this year’s World Muscle Society Virtual Congress (WMS).\\n\\nDr. Craig McDonald, the national principal investigator for the HOPE-2 clinical trial and UC Davis professor and chair of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation commented,\\xa0“This groundbreaking study is extremely exciting as we saw statistically significant changes of CAP-1002 in both skeletal and cardiac function. For these older boys who have limited therapeutic options, these data support the belief that CAP-1002 may become an important therapeutic option and possibly slow the progression of DMD.”\\n\\nHOPE-2 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 clinical trial of the Company’s lead investigational therapy, CAP-1002, in boys and young men who have DMD and are non-ambulant, the later stage of the disease process. The trial was conducted at nine sites across the United States. Study patients were treated via intravenous delivery with either CAP-1002 (150 million cells per infusion) or placebo every 3 months. Data from a total of 20 patients was analyzed (12 placebo and 8 treated) at the 12-month time-point in the intent to treat (ITT) population. Approximately 80% of the patients were non-ambulant and all patients were on a stable regimen of steroids. Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups. Final data analysis demonstrated that young men in the advanced stages of DMD experienced improvements in skeletal and cardiac measurements after receiving four doses of CAP-1002 over the course of 1 year.\\n\\nSubjects in the trial were evaluated using the Performance of the Upper Limb (PUL), a validated tool specifically designed for assessing high (shoulder), mid (elbow) and distal (wrist & hand) function, with a conceptual framework reflecting the progression of weakness in upper limb function.\\n\\nFinal Efficacy Results\\n\\n12-month Difference in Change from Baseline† Δ, CAP-1002 vs. Placebo (n=8, n=12)p-valueSkeletal Muscle (Upper Limb Function)Mid-level PUL (version 1.2)2.60.01Shoulder + Mid + Distal PUL (version 1.2)3.20.02Shoulder + Mid + Distal PUL (version 2.0)1.80.04Cardiac Function LV Ejection Fraction %4.00.002LV End Diastolic Volume, Indexed mL/m2-12.4‡0.03LV End Systolic Volume, Indexed mL/m2-4.2‡0.01Creatine Kinase-MB (% of total CK)-2.2‡0.02\\n\\n†Non-parametric mixed model repeated measures analysis with percentile ranked baseline, treatment, visit, visit-by-treatment interaction, PUL entry-item score at stratification, and site as model effects. Percentile ranked change from baseline converted back to original scale. \\r\\n‡Negative value favors CAP-1002.\\r\\nITT (intent-to-treat) population shown.\\n\\nCAP-1002 was generally safe and well tolerated throughout the study. With the exception of two hypersensitivity reactions early in the clinical trial, which were mitigated with a common pre-medication regimen, there were no serious safety signals identified by the HOPE-2 Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).\\n\\n“The significance of this data is vitally important to patients and the DMD community. The data suggests that CAP-1002 slowed the decline of DMD in patients for whom few options currently exist,” said Dr. Linda Marbán, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Capricor. “Now that we have clarity from the FDA and based on the strength of this data set, we are poised to embark on the HOPE-3 pivotal trial once we have secured an appropriate partner that can help drive CAP-1002 forward towards commercialization. Most importantly, we are thankful to the patients and families who participated in this study so that we can demonstrate the impact of CAP-1002 in treating DMD.”\\n\\nThese data were recently accepted at this year’s World Muscle Society Virtual Congress as a late-breaking oral presentation, due to its high-impact research findings that are of great interest to congress participants. The late-breaking results will be presented today, September 24, 2021.\\n\\nThis is the second clinical trial investigating CAP-1002 showing similar results in the treatment of DMD patients. Capricor completed the HOPE-Duchenne (Phase 1/2) trial in 2019, the results of which were published in\\xa0Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. The Company has initiated a technology transfer with Lonza, a leading global CMO to prepare for commercial manufacturing of CAP-1002.\\n\\nDr. McDonald is a professor of pediatrics, professor and chair of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, director of Rehabilitation Services and director of the Neuromuscular Disease Clinics at UC Davis Health. He has served as a principal investigator for more than 30 industry-sponsored trials for DMD and is the study chair for the Duchenne Natural History Study of the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group, a consortium of medical and scientific investigators from academic and research centers who share the common goal of aiming to positively impact the lives of neuromuscular disease patients and their families by conducting well-controlled clinical studies.\\n\\nConference Call and Webcast Details Capricor will host a conference call and webcast with slides today, September 24, 2021, at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss the final data of the HOPE-2 study.

       "  'title': 'Global Pet Insurance Market (2021 to 2026) - Growth, Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts',\n",
       "  'content': 'Dublin, Sept.  24, 2021  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Pet Insurance Market - Growth, Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts (2021 - 2026)\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com\\'s offering.\\n\\nThe Pet Insurance market is expected to register a CAGR of 7.1% during the forecast period.\\n\\nAs per the American Veterinary Medical Association 2020, there was a survey conducted for practice owners wherein it was concluded that an increasing number of veterinary practices are using telemedicine, and precautionary lockdown measures are being carried out with only critical cases being attended to. However, COVID-19 is having a slightly negative impact on the pet insurance market as the diagnosis and treatment procedures are witnessing decreasing rates.\\n\\nThe factors that are driving the market growth include an increasing number of pet adoption and rising awareness regarding pet insurance. According to the People\\'s Dispensary for Sick Animals, in the United Kingdom (UK), the pet dog and cat population in 2013 was found to be 7.8 million and 9.5 million, respectively, which increased to 9.9 million and 10.9 million, respectively, in 2019.\\n\\nIn addition, as per the report \\'\\'Pets in Australia: A national survey of pets and people\\'\\' in 2019, the expenditure on pets has increased tremendously owing to the increasing pet adoption. The report estimated that people spend over AUD 13 billion per year to keep the pets fed, healthy, and well-accessorized, with food and veterinary services continuing to account for half of all ongoing expenditure. Out of this, nearly 2.6 billion were spent on veterinary services in the country. Therefore, the rise in disposable income is another major factor influencing animal health expenditure. Apart from the per capita animal health expenditure, industries across the world are also spending more in the field of veterinary disease diagnosis and treatment.\\n\\nMoreover, the adoption of pet health insurance is exploding in popularity because of a strong economy, improved consumer awareness, high disposable income, and easier claims processing across the world. The pet health insurance coverage is expected to reimburse the diagnostic testing and imaging (e.g. X-rays, ultrasound, and MRI), and it covers every accident and illness under one policy. Some of the most common diagnostic tests covered by pet insurance are radiographs, ultrasounds, CT scans, and MRIs.\\n\\nAccording to the North American Pet Health Insurance Association (NAPHIA), in 2019, the adoption rates of pet health insurance in the United States was observed to be about 2.3% among dogs compared to 1.7% in 2017 and 0.4% in cats compared to 0.3% in the year 2017. This indicates the rising adoption of pet health insurance among pet owners, which is expected to positively impact the market. There are also many players operating worldwide, and many of these players market multiple white label or co-branded products with the help of pet insurance. Furthermore, there is also an increase in the entry of new players, including Figo Pet Insurance, 4Paws Insurance, and Toto Pet Insurance. Thus, the rise in adoption of pet animals and increasing awareness for pet insurance is expected boost the growth of the Pet Insurance market over the forecast period.\\n\\nKey Market Trends\\n\\nDogs Segment is Expected to Show Lucrative Growth Opportunity in the Global Pet Insurance Market\\n\\nThe past few years have observed a significant rise in the adoption of animals, especially dogs, as they are among the favorite companions of human beings. According to \"The Federation Cynologique Internationale\", the approximate total number of dogs (PURE-BRED OR NOT) registered in 2019 is found to be 9,950,000 as compared to 9,000,000 in 2017.?Therefore, with the high number and demand for dogs, there is a corresponding increase in the number of insurances for dogs.\\n\\nMoreover, the prevalence of several diseases among dogs coupled with high prices of treatments are the major contributor to the adoption of pet insurance among dogs. Dogs get cancer almost at the same rate at which humans get, while cats get affected by cancer in fewer numbers. According to the Veterinary Cancer Society, cancer is the leading cause of death in 47% of dogs, especially those that are over the age of 10, globally. Even though in most cases, cancer is a disease found in aging animals, however, some families or breeds of dogs, such as Rottweiler, Bernese Mountain Dog, and Bouvier des Flandres, German Shepherd, Great Dane, Labrador Retriever, Bichon Frise, Boxer, and Golden Retriever have a higher incidence or tendency for developing cancer at a young age.\\n\\nAs per a report published by Association of British Insurers in 2019, reported that 4.8 million pets in the United Kingdom are insured, of which 2.8 million are dogs. This data indicates that there is a huge adoption of pet insurance among dogs due to huge burden of diseases among dogs. All these afore mentioned factors are expected to propel market growth.\\n\\nNorth America Dominates the Global Pet Insurance Market\\n\\nIn the North American region, the United States accounted for the largest market share. High pet ownership, awareness, increasing pet insurance, and technological advancements in the diagnostics field are the major driving factors in the US region. The country\\'s socio-economic conditions are good enough to give economic support to the market on the production and at the end-user level. In the United States, 67% of US households, or about 85 million families, own a pet, according to the 2019-2020 National Pet Owners Survey conducted by the American Pet Products Association (APPA). According to the American Pet Products Association\\'s 2017-2018 National Pet Owners Survey, the total number of dogs owned was 89.7 million and cats were 94.2 million in the United States. In 2018, the data published by APPA stated that the total pet healthcare expenditure was USD 75.38 billion by 2019, while the expenditure in 2017 was USD 69.51 billion.\\n\\nMoreover, in October 2019, Embrace entered into a partnership with PawSupport for a 24/7 Pet Help Line for assistance through online chat, email, and video chat. This strategy is expected to rovide new services to policyholders. This strategy enabled company to expand their operations, thereby strengthening their market presence. Hence, owing to all these market development strategies currently happening in this region is expected to propel market growth.\\n\\nKey Topics Covered:\\r\\n\\r\\n1 INTRODUCTION\\r\\n\\r\\n2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\\r\\n\\r\\n3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\r\\n\\r\\n4 MARKET DYNAMICS\\r\\n4.1 Market Overview\\r\\n4.2 Market Drivers\\r\\n4.2.1 Increasing Number of Pet Adoption\\r\\n4.2.2 Rising Awareness Regarding Pet Insurance\\r\\n4.3 Market Restraints\\r\\n4.3.1 Lack of Standardized Pet Health Codes for Reimbursement\\r\\n4.3.2 Low Adoption in Emerging Countries\\r\\n4.4 Porter\\'s Five Force Analysis\\r\\n\\r\\n5 MARKET SEGMENTATION\\r\\n5.1 By Policy\\r\\n5.2 By Animal\\r\\n5.3 By Provider\\r\\n5.4 Geography\\r\\n\\r\\n6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE\\r\\n6.1 Company Profiles\\r\\n6.1.1 Anicom Holdings Inc\\r\\n6.1.2 Embrace Pet Insurance Agency, LLC\\r\\n6.1.3 Figo Pet Insurance LLC.\\r\\n6.1.4 Hartville Group\\r\\n6.1.5 Healthy Paws Pet Insurance, LLC\\r\\n6.1.6 Hollard\\r\\n6.1.7 Oneplan\\r\\n6.1.8 Petfirst Healthcare LLC\\r\\n6.1.9 Petplan\\r\\n6.1.10 The Oriental Insurance Company Ltd.\\r\\n6.1.11 Medibank Private Limited\\r\\n\\r\\n7 MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND FUTURE TRENDS\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/qt8i6w',\n",

       "  'title': 'Worldwide Polystyrene Industry to 2026 - China to Dominate the Asia-Pacific Region',\n",
       "  'content': 'Dublin, Sept.  24, 2021  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Polystyrene Market - Growth, Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts (2021 - 2026)\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com\\'s offering.\\n\\nThe polystyrene market size was estimated at over USD 30 billion in 2020, and the market is projected to register a CAGR of over 4% during the forecast period (2021-2026).\\n\\nThe market was negatively impacted by COVID-19 in 2020. The global residential home construction revenue has witnessed a decline of 7% in 2020, compared to 2019, owing to lockdowns, unavailability of raw materials, and shortage of laborers. At the same time, demand for packaging products, including food packaging and non-food packaging, has increased owing to the rising trend of consumer spending on e-commerce and food delivery applications, thereby positively impacting the demand for polystyrene.\\n\\nOver the short term, major factors driving the market studied are recycling in the polystyrene industry and the growing consumer electronics market. The global consumer electronics industry has been growing rapidly across the world over the years, owing to the consistently increasing demand for cellular phones, portable computing devices, gaming systems, and other personal electronic devices. For instance, the Indian electronics market is expected to reach USD 400 billion by 2025. Additionally, India is expected to become the fifth-largest consumer electronics and appliances industry in the world by 2025.\\n\\nOn the flip side, increasing the ban on polystyrene across North America and Europe and the availability of high-performance substitutes are likely to hinder the market. Asia-Pacific dominated the market across the world, with the largest consumption in countries such as India and China.\\n\\nKey Market Trends\\n\\nHigh Impact Polystyrene (HIPS) Type to Dominate the Market\\n\\nHigh impact polystyrene contains rubber. It is less transparent than GPPS. It is mainly used for products that require high-impact resistance.HIPS has a standard flow but is less glossy than GPPS. It is crack-resistant and is used in injection molding. HIPS also has good dimensional stability. It is easy to paint and glue and has a low cost. It is used for housing and covers, low-strength structural components, printed graphics, models and prototypes, fixtures, etc. Majorly, HIPS are sold in high and medium grades. Other grades include ignition resistance, high-gloss grades, and environment stress crack-resistant grade.Packaging is the largest segment for HIPS. It is used for food packaging (of meat trays, egg cartons, fruit trays, dairy packaging, etc.), industrial packaging, and consumer packaging ( of cassettes, CD covers, etc.).Driven by the rise in population, demand for packaged food and beverage is set to witness further growth during the forecast period. The unprecedented shift from rural to urban living is a major demographic that is impacting the global consumption of packaged food.China stands to be the world\\'s largest manufacturing economy and exporter, due to which the country\\'s packaging requirement is huge. The packaging industry in China is expected to register tremendous growth, with a CAGR of nearly 6.8%, to reach CNY 2 trillion during the forecast period.However, the United States has banned the use of polystyrene in food packaging products such as boxes, containers, and carry bags, which is likely to impact the market growth negatively.HIPS are also used majorly in electronic and appliances applications, such as in computer housings, TV housings, and freezer and refrigerator liners appliances housings.Asia-Pacific is the largest consumer of high-impact polystyrene. It also produces about half of the world\\'s HIPS. Europe and North America follow Asia-Pacific in consumption. Asia-Pacific is forecasted to be the fastest-growing region during the forecast period.\\n\\nChina to Dominate the Asia-Pacific Region\\n\\nChina\\'s construction industry developed rapidly due to the central government\\'s push for infrastructure investment as a means to sustain economic growth.However, due to the onset of COVID-19 in 2020, the economic growth of China is now expected to contract to a considerable extent. According to International Monetary Fund, the country\\'s GDP is estimated to have grown by 1.9% in 2020 while recovering to 8.2% growth in 2021, subject to post-pandemic recovery.China\\'s 13th Five Year Plan started in 2016, and it was an important year for the country\\'s engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) industry. In addition, the country ventured into new business models domestically and internationally during the year. Although the construction sector slowed down after 2013, it is still a major contributor to the GDP of the country.The country announced 300 major construction projects in Beijing in 2019. These 300 projects included 100 infrastructure projects, 100 projects focusing on the improvement of people\\'s livelihoods, and 100 projects for high-end technological industries. The investment of the projects is expected to reach USD 35 billion.Moreover, the country witnessed rapid growth in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) market. The growth of the FMCG market was majorly driven by the increased spending on premium and healthier products by the middle-class consumers in the country.China is the world\\'s largest electronics production base and offers tough competition to the existing upstream producers, like South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. Electronic products, such as smartphones, OLED TVs, tablets, and so on, have the highest growth in the market in the consumer electronics segment. With the increase in the disposable income of the middle-class population, the demand for electronic products is projected to grow in the near future.Furthermore, the Chinese government has started implementing policies to support and encourage innovations in medical devices. The \"Made in China 2025\" initiative aims to improve industry efficiency, product quality, and brand reputation. This is expected to increase the number of domestic medical device manufacturers, thus, increasing the competitiveness in the market. Demand for polystyrene exists in the medical device sector, in disposable items, such as tissue culture trays, test tubes, Petri dishes, diagnostic components, and housing for test kits, among many others.The medical device market in China is considered to be one of the fastest-growing market sectors and was estimated to cross over USD 95 billion by the end of 2020. The number of private hospitals in the country is relatively small, and the healthcare product procurement is majorly driven by large public hospitals, which has led to the increasing usage of medical devices in public hospitals and thus has stimulated the demand for optical coatings from the sector.In 2019, Chinese health expenditure was recorded to be ~USD 750 billion, which accounted for ~5.3% of the country\\'s GDP. The medical device market in China has been witnessing strong growth with a growing number of hospitals and increasing demand for medical assistance. According to the China Association for Medical Device Industry, the medical device market size was recorded to be around ~USD 80 billion in 2019. About 70% of the growth was majorly fueled by hospital procurement.Hence, with the growth in the various end-user industries in the country, the demand for polystyrene is estimated to increase during the forecast period.\\n\\nKey Topics Covered:\\r\\n\\r\\n1 INTRODUCTION\\r\\n\\r\\n2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\\r\\n\\r\\n3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\r\\n\\r\\n4 MARKET DYNAMICS\\r\\n4.1 Drivers\\r\\n4.1.1 Recycling in the Polystyrene Industry\\r\\n4.1.2 Growing Consumer Electronics Market\\r\\n4.2 Restraints\\r\\n4.2.1 Increasing Ban on Polystyrene across North America and Europe\\r\\n4.2.2 Availability of High-performance Substitutes\\r\\n4.2.3 Impact of COVID-19\\r\\n4.3 Industry Value Chain Analysis\\r\\n4.4 Porter\\'s Five Forces Analysis\\r\\n\\r\\n5 MARKET SEGMENTATION\\r\\n5.1 Resin Type\\r\\n5.1.1 General Purpose Polystyrene (GPPS)\\r\\n5.1.2 High Impact Polystyrene (HIPS)\\r\\n5.1.3 Expandable Polystyrene (EPS)\\r\\n5.2 Form Type\\r\\n5.2.1 Foams\\r\\n5.2.2 Films and Sheets\\r\\n5.2.3 Injection Molding\\r\\n5.2.4 Other Form Types\\r\\n5.3 End-user Industry\\r\\n5.3.1 Packaging\\r\\n5.3.2 Building and Construction\\r\\n5.3.3 Electrical and Electronics\\r\\n5.3.4 Consumer Goods\\r\\n5.3.5 Other End-user Industries\\r\\n5.4 Geography\\r\\n5.4.1 Asia-Pacific\\r\\n5.4.1.1 China\\r\\n5.4.1.2 India\\r\\n5.4.1.3 Japan\\r\\n5.4.1.4 South Korea\\r\\n5.4.1.5 Rest of Asia-Pacific\\r\\n5.4.2 North America\\r\\n5.4.2.1 United States\\r\\n5.4.2.2 Canada\\r\\n5.4.2.3 Mexico\\r\\n5.4.3 Europe\\r\\n5.4.3.1 Germany\\r\\n5.4.3.2 United Kingdom\\r\\n5.4.3.3 France\\r\\n5.4.3.4 Italy\\r\\n5.4.3.5 Rest of Europe\\r\\n5.4.4 South America\\r\\n5.4.4.1 Brazil\\r\\n5.4.4.2 Argentina\\r\\n5.4.4.3 Rest of South America\\r\\n5.4.5 Middle-East and Africa\\r\\n5.4.5.1 Saudi Arabia\\r\\n5.4.5.2 South Africa\\r\\n5.4.5.3 Rest of Middle-East and Africa\\r\\n\\r\\n6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE\\r\\n6.1 Mergers and Acquisitions, Joint Ventures, Collaborations, and Agreements\\r\\n6.2 Market Share/Ranking Analysis\\r\\n6.3 Strategies Adopted by Leading Players\\r\\n6.4 Company Profiles\\r\\n6.4.1 Atlas Molded Products\\r\\n6.4.2 Alpek S.A.B. de CV\\r\\n6.4.3 Americas Styrenics LLC (AmSty)\\r\\n6.4.4 BASF SE\\r\\n6.4.5 CHIMEI\\r\\n6.4.6 Formosa Chemicals & Fibre Corp.\\r\\n6.4.7 INEOS Styrolution Group GmbH\\r\\n6.4.8 Innova\\r\\n6.4.9 KUMHO PETROCHEMICAL\\r\\n6.4.10 LG Chem\\r\\n6.4.11 SABIC\\r\\n6.4.12 Synthos\\r\\n6.4.13 Total\\r\\n6.4.14 Trinseo\\r\\n6.4.15 Versalis SpA\\r\\n\\r\\n7 MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND FUTURE TRENDS\\r\\n7.1 Ongoing Research to Develop Bio-based Polystyrene\\r\\n7.2 Other Opportunities\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/6nxwuu',\n",

       "  'content': 'WASHINGTON, Sept.  24, 2021  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Equipment Leasing and Finance Association’s (ELFA) Monthly Leasing and Finance Index (MLFI-25), which reports economic activity from 25 companies representing a cross section of the $900 billion equipment finance sector, showed their overall new business volume for August was $8.5 billion, up 21 percent year-over-year from new business volume in August 2020. Volume was down 14 percent month-to-month from $9.9 billion in July. Year-to-date, cumulative new business volume was up 10 percent compared to 2020.\\n\\nReceivables over 30 days were 1.8 percent, down from 1.9 percent the previous month and down from 2.4 percent in the same period in 2020. Charge-offs were 0.23 percent, up from 0.18 percent the previous month and down from 0.75 percent in the year-earlier period.\\n\\nCredit approvals totaled 76.3 percent, down from 76.5 percent in July. Total headcount for equipment finance companies was down 14.1 percent year-over-year, a decrease due to significant downsizing at an MLFI reporting company.\\n\\nSeparately, the Equipment Leasing & Finance Foundation’s Monthly Confidence Index (MCI-EFI) in September is 60.5, a decrease from the August index of 66.6.\\n\\nELFA President and CEO Ralph Petta said, “August data show some softness in equipment demand resulting from a mix of summer doldrums, continued supply chain disruptions and lingering pandemic-related woes. Business optimism, which peaked earlier in the summer, also has waned somewhat.\\xa0However, when compared to where the economy and equipment finance business were a year ago, with the COVID-19 virus raging throughout the country, August new business volume is wholly acceptable.”\\n\\nJeffrey Hilzinger, President and CEO, Marlin Capital Solutions, said, “2021, while much better than 2020, continues to be a challenging period for the equipment finance industry.\\xa0While demand for equipment remains strong, August was the second consecutive month of reduced origination volume for the industry.\\xa0Supply chain issues continue to be a key driver underlying this trend and seem to have worsened in recent months.\\xa0On the positive side, approval rates have remained at pre-COVID levels and portfolio delinquencies and charge-offs remain at historically low levels.”\\n\\nAbout ELFA’s MLFI-25\\r\\nThe MLFI-25 is the only index that reflects capex, or the volume of commercial equipment financed in the U.S. The MLFI-25 is released globally at 8 a.m. Eastern time from Washington, D.C., each month on the day before the U.S. Department of Commerce releases the durable goods report. The MLFI-25 is a financial indicator that complements the durable goods report and other economic indexes, including the Institute for Supply Management Index, which reports economic activity in the manufacturing sector. Together with the MLFI-25 these reports provide a complete view of the status of productive assets in the U.S. economy: equipment produced, acquired and financed.\\n\\nThe MLFI-25 is a time series that reflects two years of business activity for the 25 companies currently participating in the survey. The latest MLFI-25, including methodology and participants, is available at www.elfaonline.org/Data/MLFI/.\\n\\nMLFI-25 Methodology\\r\\nELFA produces the MLFI-25 survey to help member organizations achieve competitive advantage by providing them with leading-edge research and benchmarking information to support strategic business decision making.\\n\\nThe MLFI-25 is a barometer of the trends in U.S. capital equipment investment. Five components are included in the survey: new business volume (originations), aging of receivables, charge-offs, credit approval ratios, (approved vs. submitted) and headcount for the equipment finance business.\\n\\nThe MLFI-25 measures monthly commercial equipment lease and loan activity as reported by participating ELFA member equipment finance companies representing a cross section of the equipment finance sector, including small ticket, middle-market, large ticket, bank, captive and independent leasing and finance companies. Based on hard survey data, the responses mirror the economic activity of the broader equipment finance sector and current business conditions nationally.\\n\\nAbout ELFA\\r\\nThe Equipment Leasing and Finance Association (ELFA) is the trade association that represents companies in the nearly $1 trillion equipment finance sector, which includes financial services companies and manufacturers engaged in financing capital goods.
